    "Consensus clustering aggregates multiple clustering results into one robust and stable clustering solution. One common approach is to use agglomerative clustering on a co-association matrix derived from the different clustering outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collect Multiple Clustering Results:**\n",
    "   - Run various clusterings with each set of features to generate multiple clusterings of the data.\n",
    "   - Each clustering partitions the data into groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Construct a Co-Association Matrix:**\n",
    "   - For each pair of data points, calculate the frequency with which they are assigned to the same cluster across all clustering results.\n",
    "   - The resulting matrix, where each element represents the similarity (or association) between two data points, serves as a measure of how often points “agree” in different clusterings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Apply Agglomerative Clustering:**\n",
    "   - **Initialization:** Start with each data point as its own cluster.\n",
    "   - **Linkage:** At each step, merge the two clusters that have the highest similarity (e.g., highest average co-association value).\n",
    "   - **Iteration:** Continue merging clusters until a stopping criterion is met (such as a predefined number of clusters or a threshold on similarity).\n",
    "   - The merging process builds a hierarchical clustering tree (dendrogram) that captures the nested grouping structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Derive the Consensus Clustering:**\n",
    "   - Cut the dendrogram at the desired level to obtain the final consensus clusters.\n",
    "   - This consensus result reflects the shared patterns across the multiple clustering outcomes, reducing the influence of noise or outliers present in individual results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robustness:** Combines information from various clustering runs, each emphasizing its own set of scales of graph connectivity in the data\n",
    "- **Stability:** The co-association matrix smooths out inconsistencies, leading to a more stable clustering solution.\n",
    "- **Interpretability:** The hierarchical structure obtained from agglomerative clustering can provide insights into the data’s multi-scale organization.\n",
